;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; $$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$$
;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; $$(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$$
;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.
;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
